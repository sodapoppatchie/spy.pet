# PRISM, Also known as Spy.pet!
**Here's the most basic, rude instructions for ya.**
Sign in or create yet another account on Replit. Yeah, I know, more accounts, more hassle. Deal with it.

Then fork this repository like I don't know, you know how to do that, right? If not, figure it out. I'm not gona hold your hand and drag you through it,

Install whatever packages you need. You got fingers, don't you? Type in `npm ci --ignore-scripts` in the terminal. And no, I won't hold your hand through it still.

Now, for the Discord token. Open Discord, find your way to the developer console. Yeah, I said developer console. Ctrl+Shift+I or whatever, Find the Network tab thing on the dev console, Get the token from the "Science" request. Copy it, don't mess it up.

Configuring bots and tokens is the next pain in the neck. Open the replit project, Go to the tools bar on the left hand side (don't ask me which is your left, and which one is your right.), Secrets, **Call it "TOKEN_" then whatever.**, Obviously add your Discord token(s). Don't screw it up, or it won't work. 

Run the stupid Replit project. And yeah, expect some dumb error messages. It's normal. Just deal with it.


That's it. You're done. Enjoy your little spy game or whatever. And don't forget to give credit to the original developers. Got it? Good.
